# Encoding-Categorical-Data-in-Machine-Learning
Categorical data are variables that can be divided into categories or groups. When working with machine learning algorithms, it is necessary to encode categorical data into numerical data so that the algorithms can process it. There are three common encoding methods: ordinal encoding, label encoding, and one-hot encoding.

# Ordinal Encoding
Ordinal encoding is used when there is a clear order or relation between the categories, such as the education level (school < UG < PG).

# One-Hot-Encoding
For nominal data with no order or relation between the categories, use one-hot encoding. One-hot encoding can result in a high-dimensional dataset.
# Label Encoding
It is recommended to use label encoding for the target column in your data if it is categorical
